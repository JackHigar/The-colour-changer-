# The-colour-changer
The colour changer , it is a simple html page with  with a change me button when we click that it simply change color 
I am Jack HIGAR, I knowed javascript very little in past but not that much so I am relearning it
people say that project based learning is the best path to do it and I am doing that only 

This is s simple colour changer click the button and see the page changing color .
I dont think anyone would like to domload or use it as it is so simple but if anyone want to you are
